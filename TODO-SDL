Priorities
==========
   * Clean out old unused files - scons build system is dead, cmake is the way to go.
   * GTK GUI was not cross-platform. Has been replaced in favor of Qt5. Need to clean out dead code.
   * Cheat Editor will be a high priority.
   * Code cleanup. Lots of compiler warning with newer GCC. Maybe I'm OCD... but these warnings bother me.

Features
========
   * Emulator no runs as a separate thread from the GUI. Much improved performance.
   * Cross platform QT GUI is fully functional minus Debug Tools and Cheat Menu.
  
QT
===
   * Clean out rest of old GTK comments and #ifdefs
	* GUI Cheat editor TODO
	* GUI Debug Tools TODO
   * GUI should compile in windows as well.... but testing is not a priority since the windows gui has a totally separate backend.

DOCS
====
	* Docs REALLY need a cleanup/rewrite
